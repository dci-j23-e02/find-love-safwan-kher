## Overview:
**char is** a primitive data type whereas **String is** a class in **java**.
**char** represents a single **character** whereas **String** can have zero or more characters. So **String is** _immutable_  objects representing a **character sequence**. We define **char** in **java** program using single quote `'` whereas we can define **String in Java** using double quotes `â€œ`.

:heart: Hide Your ***LOVE*** characters behind your strings.
### Create four strings, exactly as shown below :
> - The first string should contain the text "living zebras".
> - The second should contain "juicy oranges".
> - The third should contain "do the victory dance".
> - The fourth should contain "tusk of an elephant".

### Print all four strings to the screen, THEN:
>  1. Read the **1st character** from the **1st string** and print the
           character to the screen.
>  2. Read the **7th character** from the **2nd string** and print the character to the screen.
>  3. Read the **8th character** from the **3rd string** and print the character to the screen.
>  4. Read the **12th character** from the **4th string** and print the character to the screen.

>**Hint:** use the String method charAt(int index) to read a character at the specified index in a string.

### Output:
l  
o  
v  
e
